// A. TASK 1:VARIABLES and OPERATORS
// 1. Create a variable called “language” and assign it the value “JavaScript”. Then create
// a variable called “score” and assign it the value “10”.
let language = 'javascript';
let score = 10;

// 2.Create two variables called “length” and “width”. Assign each variable a value of 10 and 5 respectfully.
let length = 10;
let width = 5;
// Use the variables to calculate the area of a rectangle with the length and width specified (remember area = length x width).
let rectangle = length * width
// Write the following to the console using CONCATENATION and BACKTICKS: 
console.log('The area of the rectangle is'.concat(rectangle));
// “The area of the rectangle is …” where … is the area you calculated.

// 3.Create two variables called “num1” and “num2.” Assign each variable a value of 10 and 4 respectfully.
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 4;
// Calculate and display in the console what the remainder is if num1 is divided by num2.
console.log(num1 / num2);

// 4.Using the variables you created in the previous step, output the results
// of the division in the following format: “num1 / num2 = x remainder y.” HINT: Backticks
let numberOne = 10,
    numberTwo = 4;
console.log(`numberOne / numberTwo = ${~~(numberOne / numberTwo)} remainder ${~~(numberOne % numberTwo)}`)

// B. Task 2:Data Types
// 1. Define the following data types with your own contents[ 'integer', 'decimal', 'string', 'array'(minimum: 3 items), 'Object'(minimum: 4 values)]
let integer(-1, -2, -3);
let decimal(1.20, 2.20, 3.20);
let string("Ty Johnson");
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW", "Mercedes"];
